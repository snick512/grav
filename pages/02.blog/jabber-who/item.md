So, for the longest time I relied on a third-party jabber host and this was probably a bad idea. The host did in fact end up going belly up, as far as I know, and I lost usage. The usage was willingly due to the SSL certificate becoming invalid. 

Skipping forward to today, I am shopping for XMPP/Jabber servers. So far I've tried:

- Prosody
- ejabberd
- Openfire

It's looking as if prosody will be the winner but we'll see!

Updated April 5: Prosody is the winner!
