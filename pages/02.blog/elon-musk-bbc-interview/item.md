Consistently interrupting Musk, asking the same questions in different form, presumably because the answer given wasn't wanted. 

The interviewer also lacks a sense of humor when the gestures are pointed at them or the company responsible for bringing him there. 

While It wasn't me presented with the opportunity to interview Musk, here are some topics I believe would've been way more interesting and on point to discuss. 

Topics missed: 

* AI: General artificial intelligence integration
* AI: Direct and indirect contributions.
* Society: Building more open platforms
* Society: Opening the API to verified users and or non verified users or maintain an open API for accessibility
* Ai: Objectivity
