Search engines are already powered by several algorithms to stay updated and relevant - relevant to the user. And Google - largely - does the best job at this. When I search for something, its engine understands the likelihood of what I "actually" want to see v. what may have first come up on its table. In other words, it's not Duck Duck Go, not that I dislike DDG, it's just not for me.

We give up not privacy for the relevancy Google provides, we already handed over our thoughts from the search query alone. We can't blame Google for this, we gave "it" the data. 

Some discuss artificial intelligence replacing search engines, but there is integration of it (AI) already. It's mild, but has major effects on how we search for and end up on websites. Do not alter this.

If you want a "chat bot" to guide you through the web, great, but let's not attempt to let a query such as, "How to cook BBQ chicken" bring us to a website of its choosing by default. This would be placing AI directly in the driver's seat. It's fine as a co-pilot.

Does anyone use I'm feeling lucky?
