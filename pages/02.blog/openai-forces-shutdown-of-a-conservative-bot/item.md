**Opinion?**


AI should not be leaning towards one political side.


The idea of "if it could lean towards one" side isn't far fetched as the article states it was being done. Even with knowing this is a terrible idea, it would be interesting to review its outcome, se, by having an equally opposing bot (a not so conservative bot).


In other words, maybe it _is_ worth exploring potential negative and positive ressults of politically charged bot minds. We all know some people cannot be in the same room while discussing open border policy, so why not let some robots try it out?
