> "That's the future we're driving towards â€” with everyone in the floating chairs, drinking their food out of straws, and constant 24/7 entertainment," Dorsey said in an interview this week with "Breaking Points" hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti on Monday --[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/jack-dorsey-worries-apple-vision-pro-will-turn-us-all-into-wall-e-characters-glued-to-chairs-and-plugged-into-constant-entertainment/articleshow/100990615.cms)

*Quick note: I personally prefer Google Glass and Magic Leap designs regarding AR. Their designs should be used as baselines for practical applications.*

Would it be surprising this is the way the world is going? At least first world countries may take part in this emerging luxury based "augmented reality." 

We already exhibit drone status by staring into our computer screens throughout work days and we continue this behaviour elsewhere with our smartphones. There's _virtualy_ no separation of the hand and smartphone today - Even I am guilty of being wired to the smartphone - would adding goggles to the mix _really_ make a difference? 

## Let's skip to the "future"

But first...

Augmented reality glasses aren't exactly anything new, but as usual it took a very large company to "make it user friendly" or consumer facing. 

> The earliest functional AR systems that provided immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early 1990s, starting with the Virtual Fixtures system developed at the U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratory in 1992.

**1990s!** Imagine having an Apple Vision Pro headset on in the 1990s! Even with titles such as *Back to the Future* in 1985, I find it awfully difficult to believe people would be comfortable with headgear (for everyday applications). 

## Practical Augmented Reality applications

Namely, and maybe I'm a bit biased here--accessiblity plays a major role in AR. Microsoft Seeing AI is notable to me due to how smooth it operates. I'd like this to be streamlined to a pair of glasses. AR is THIS straightforward. 

Let me walk into a grocery store with my AI infused vision--enabling me to see prices from afar, alert me of wanted items, price changes and much....much more. There's nearly no end here.

Let context bubbles emerge from faces to let me know who they are. 



I welcome it! I should point out I don't welcome people droning away in their environments.



However, AR is the way. I hope you have a good day and thank you for reading!
